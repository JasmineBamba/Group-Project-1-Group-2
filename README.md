# Data Cleaning
- To explore whether there is a correlation between CO2 emissions and the frequency of wildfires in Canada.
- To track and visualize the historical number of wildfires in Canada over the years.
- To investigate the potential correlation between wildfire frequency and the months of the year.
- To assess the impact of deforestation on fire spread patterns compared to natural forested areas.
- To plot the causes of wildfire
- To analyse the cause of wildires in different provinces. 

# Team questions:

- Caroline: Impact of Deforestation on Fire Behavior: Analyze fire spread patterns in deforested areas compared to natural forested areas. Is there a correlation between frequency of wildfire and the CO2 emissions?

- Nikita: Calculate the no. of wildfires in each month
          Map the trend if any to understand if there are few months where the frequency of the wildfire is more Correlation

- Jasmine: Calculate the number of wildfires for each cause class. Is there a correlation between the frequency of wildfires and the different cause classes?
           Map the trend, if any, to understand if certain cause classes are more prevalent in contributing to wildfires.

# Data Cleaning
For this project, extensive data cleaning was performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset used for analysis. The following data cleaning tasks were applied to the raw data:

- Handling Missing Values: Missing data points were carefully handled by either imputing them with appropriate statistical measures or, when necessary, removing the rows or columns with missing values.
- Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records in the dataset were identified and removed to prevent any bias in the analysis.
- Dealing with Outliers: Outliers were identified and appropriately handled, either by removing them or transforming them using statistical techniques.
- Removing Irrelevant Information: Unnecessary columns or data points that did not contribute to the analysis were removed to streamline the dataset.
- Checking Data Integrity: A thorough validation was performed to verify data integrity and cross-reference it with the data source.
