### Team question division: 


- C.B Impact of Deforestation on Fire Behavior:
      Analyze fire spread patterns in deforested areas compared to natural forested areas.
- N.B Is there a correlation between temperature increase and wildfire frequency?
      Track the number of wildfires in Canada over the years.
      Plot the wildfire frequency against the temperature trends to identify if there's any correlation

- N.G Is there a correlation between frequency of wildfire and the CO2 emissions? 
       Calculate the no. of wildfires in each month  
       Map the trend if any to understand if there are few months where the frequency of the wildfire is more
       Correlation

- J.B. Is there a correlation between the frequency of wildfires and the different cause classes?  
      Calculate the number of wildfires for each cause class. 
      Map the trend, if any, to understand if certain cause classes are more prevalent in contributing to wildfires.
