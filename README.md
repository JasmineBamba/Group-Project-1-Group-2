### Team question division: 


- Caroline Impact of Deforestation on Fire Behavior:
      Analyze fire spread patterns in deforested areas compared to natural forested areas.

- Nikita Is there a correlation between frequency of wildfire and the CO2 emissions? 
       Calculate the no. of wildfires in each month  
       Map the trend if any to understand if there are few months where the frequency of the wildfire is more
       Correlation

- Jasmine Is there a correlation between the frequency of wildfires and the different cause classes?  
      Calculate the number of wildfires for each cause class. 
      Map the trend, if any, to understand if certain cause classes are more prevalent in contributing to wildfires.

### Data Cleaning

For this project, extensive data cleaning was performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset used for analysis. The following data cleaning tasks were applied to the raw data:

- Handling Missing Values: Missing data points were carefully handled by either imputing them with appropriate statistical measures or, when necessary, removing the rows or columns with missing values.
- Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records in the dataset were identified and removed to prevent any bias in the analysis.
- Dealing with Outliers: Outliers were identified and appropriately handled, either by removing them or transforming them using statistical techniques.
- Removing Irrelevant Information: Unnecessary columns or data points that did not contribute to the analysis were removed to streamline the dataset.
- Checking Data Integrity: A thorough validation was performed to verify data integrity and cross-reference it with the data source.
